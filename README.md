# server-nest-api

## Introduction

Welcome to the "server-nest-api" repository. This project contains incomplete demonstration code for a shopping list API developed using Nest.js. The purpose of this code is solely to demonstrate potential features and architecture using Nest.js; therefore, it is not intended for production use and will not function fully if attempted to run as-is.

## Project Overview

"server-nest-api" is designed to manage shopping and purchase lists. The API allows for operations such as creating, updating, and retrieving shopping lists, with a focus on simplicity and effectiveness in handling typical tasks associated with shopping planning.

## Key Technologies

- **Nest.js**: A progressive Node.js framework for building efficient and scalable server-side applications.
- **TypeScript**: Used throughout the project for its robust typing system that enhances code quality and maintainability.
- **Mongoose**: An ODM (Object Data Modeling) library for MongoDB and Node.js, providing a higher level of abstraction for database interaction.
- **JWT (JSON Web Tokens)**: Employed for secure and scalable user authentication.
- **Passport**: A middleware for Node.js that simplifies the process of handling authentication.

## Core Features

1. **User Authentication**: Secure login and registration processes.
2. **Shopping List Management**: Users can create, update, and delete their shopping lists.
3. **Product Addition**: Allows users to add products to their lists.

## Technologies Overview

Here's a brief look at some of the other libraries and dependencies used in this project:

- **@nestjs/common**, **@nestjs/core**: Fundamental building blocks of any Nest.js application.
- **class-validator**, **class-transformer**: Used for data validation and transformation.
- **bcryptjs**: Provides password hashing functionalities.
- **rxjs**: Utilized for handling asynchronous and event-based programs using observable sequences.

## Disclaimer

This code is provided as is, for demonstration purposes only, and not meant to serve as a fully functional application. The repository does not include complete functionality, and there are no guarantees provided regarding the performance or security of the code.
